# Sale-Insights-Data-Analysis-Project
PowerBI Data Analysis Project

This repository hosts a data analysis project focused on the examination and analysis of sales from an Ecommerce store.

Within this project, I've crafted a dynamic dashboard that offers comprehensive insights into the dataset.

In the process of exploring meaningful insights and reaching conclusions, I've embraced PowerBI as a new tool, broadening my analytical capabilities.

Learnings From the Project :

• Constructed an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze online sales data.

• Employed intricate parameters to delve deeper into worksheets and customized views using filters and slicers.

• Established connections, integrated new tables, performed calculations for data manipulation, and facilitated user-driven parameters for visualizations.

• Utilized various customized visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers.
